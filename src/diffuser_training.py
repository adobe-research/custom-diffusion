#       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
#       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
#       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
#       and conversions to other media types.

#       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
#       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
#       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
#       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

#       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
#       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
#       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
#       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
#       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
#       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
#       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

#       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including

#       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
#       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and

#    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
#       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
#       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
#       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
#       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
#       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

#    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
#       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

#       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
#       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
#       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
#       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
#       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
#       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
#       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
#       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
#       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
#       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
#       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
#       as of the date such litigation is filed.

#    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
#       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
#       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
#       meet the following conditions:

#       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
#           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

#       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
#           stating that You changed the files; and

#       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
#           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
#           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
#           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
#           the Derivative Works; and

#       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
#           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
#           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
#           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
#           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
#           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
#           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
#           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
#           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
#           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
#           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
#           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
#           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
#           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
#           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
#           as modifying the License.

#       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
#       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
#       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
#       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
#       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
#       the conditions stated in this License.

#    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
#       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
#       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
#       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
#       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
#       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
#       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

#    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
#       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
#       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
#       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

#    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
#       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
#       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
#       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
#       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
#       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
#       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
#       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
#       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

#    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
#       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
#       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
#       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
#       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
#       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
#       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
#       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
#       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
#       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
#       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

#    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
#       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
#       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
#       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
#       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
#       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
#       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
#       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
#       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
#       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
